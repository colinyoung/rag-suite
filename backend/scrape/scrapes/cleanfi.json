    "title": "Submitting a PPA project for BidDesk",
    "content": [
      "CleanFi’s BidDesk is designed for property improvement projects in which the property owner is looking to enter into a contract with a 3rd-party to own and operate that improvement subject to conditions for the property owner to buy all the benefits from that projects for a set period of time.",
      "For solar or micro-grid projects, BidDesk offers a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) bidding mechanism which involves the project developer or property owner uploading the documents critical to an investor’s ability to return key metrics such as price-per-kWh’s, rate riser, term of agreement, exceptions, and other annotations.",
      "BidDesk is a free service. It also provides no guarantees that investors will want to return bids to projects uploaded to the platform.  Each of our investors decides whether to compete based only on the fundamental economic merit of the project as presented.",
      "Once bids are returned, you as the project owner select the bid to which you want to apply.  The application process then looks like any other of CleanFi’s application module, except that a $250 fee required along an electronic signature in order to begin “underwriting” (financial review and risk assessment) of the property owner/off-taker and of the contractor/developer.",
      "As is the case with all applications, CleanFi will preview that application to verify that all documents are properly uploaded, and that the best risk profile possible is presented to the investor.",
      "As is true in all other financing categories returned on CleanFi, the project profile determines who sees the project.  When we onboard a financier on to CleanFi, we receive their triggering criteria of interest.  Those include minimum maximum project size or value, type of building (asset class), type of corporate structure, location, etc.   For that reason, while CleanFi holds several dozen funders at any one time, how of those will respond to the project uploaded will vary on many variables including timing.  It’s best to expect between one and six bidders for any single project.",
      "CleanFi will contact you, after you complete your project upload, to review the project with you prior to submitting it to qualifying investors.",
      "When responding to a project, investors are making optimistic assumptions about the financial strength of the off-taker, and about the capabilities of the project builder.   This is why each proposal is returned with an “Apply” button.  This involves uploading financial documents (though deeper project qualification material are usually also be requested).  Only after a full review of the application from the off-taker and builder can the investor confirm that they are willing to commit to the 20 or 25-year investment into the project at the original bid terms or modified terms.",
      "Yes, but at CleanFi’s discretion.  For example, if an applicant has been turned down strictly on the basis of weak financials, CleanFi may (after consultation with the applicant) suggest an alternative financing method rather than a resubmission to another bidder. But if an applicant with merit feels they made a error, CleanFi can help re-route their application to another bidder.  Because CleanFi gets paid upon project financing success, our team is motivated to reach a successful financing agreement.",
      "Yes, but you will have to pay the $250 fee for each bidder you apply to, and you will have to fill out each bidder’s separate application.  Also CleanFi will notify each investor to which you apply that the project is also being underwritten by one or more other investors.",
      "1- Create a preliminary engineering work-up for the size of the system, its mounting structure and placement, the components you intend to use, and the first year annual savings anticipated with that system design.  Use a reputable 3rd-party solution for that (i.e., helioscope, or one of multiple alternatives).",
      "2-We highly recommend creating a reliable 3rd party cash-flow model from a reputable online service (OpenSolar, Energy Toolbase, Aurora, etc) that demonstrates the savings that your system would deliver if it were paid in  cash.  The major challenge with your providing your own model is that the investor will not have inherent confidence in your modeling tool, and will not want to spent any time evaluating its reliability.",
      "3- Make sure that you know the “avoided cost of energy” for your project.  It is the per kWh value the client currently pays for the energy which the eventual renewable energy (RE) source will displace.  If you are new to the process of modeling these cashflow tables, make sure you are careful about valuing the impact of the new power plant on current Demand charges.",
      "4- With the client (who is the eventual “off-taker”/buyer of the energy which will be generated by the RE), set a minimum expectation you have as a benefit of an eventual PPA.",
      "This is a simple statement, like:\n– “Produce 50% of our energy from solar”, or\n– “To save at least 5% over my current cost for the equivalent power, and increase that margin of savings over 20 years”, or\n– “To stabilize my energy cost, so I know exactly how much it will cost me over the next 25 years.”",
      "Then have the client supply you with an Off-Taker Request (OTR) for PPA Proposals; this is a simple statement signed by the eventual off-taker that states the most important features of the PPA, per above.  You can use the form CleanFi provides (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S7R9BNexs25gUXOnutjKnz6UZj31epVer_ywWWxaOT4/edit?usp=sharing), or the client can write their own.",
      "Why we need the OTR?:  Investors receive many projects to consider placing their capital into for a very long term.  The bidding process is a competitive process, which requires them to evaluate whether they want to spend their time responding to that project, or to another project for which they might not have to compete and where they can have a little more time and interaction with the developer.  In order to encourage investors to consistently respond to CleanFi’s BidDesk submissions, we want to reassure them that the project is real.  Showing a personal request from an off-taker goes a long way, in addition to presenting well documented project files.\nNOTE: no investor in CleanFi’s investor database is a developer, so there is no motivation to contact the client directly.  In addition, CleanFi has a strict non-disclosure agreement with each investor who sees our projects.",
      "If you responding to a Request For Proposal (RFP), then you do not need to provide an OTR.  In the submission form, you will be given a field where to enter the link to the RFP.",
      "Once you have assembled these documents, please go to “Enter your project in BidDesk”.  You will be asked to answer questions about you, as the developer/contractor.  Remember that the investor is betting on you to be able to complete the project optimally for an entire generation worth of electric generation.  So you will see several questions require you to make your Statement of Qualification, showing your experience in building projects like the one you are submitting.",
      "If you have submitted this project to other direct investors, you must let us know to whom the project has already been submitted.   It is extremely bad form to submit a project to investors from multiple sides, and CleanFi will not favor a relationship with developer contractors who have us submit to investors that have already seen their project.  Assume that we know a lot of investors, and declare in your submission who has already seen, or is currently looking, at your project.",
      "CleanFi offers this service at no cost to you, the submitter.  We ask for and expect the courtesy of accurate information about any other party to whom you have already presented the project.  CleanFi reserves the right to refuse access to BidDesk to users who do not abide by this request.",
      "We give our funders 5 working days to return their bids.  Some will present it much earlier.\nEach time an investor responds to your project you will instantly be notified via the email associated with your CleanFi account, and you will have a link to that bid.  As other bids come in, they will be presented side-by-side.  Each will present:\n– the rate\n– the riser (if any)\n– the term\n– any exceptions related to the offer\n– any notes and conditions about their response.\nEach offer will display an Apply button within its frame.  Each application is custom to that investor.",
      "CleanFi encourages investors to reply within 5 working days.  But we can extend that period depending on the project circumstances."

    "content": [
      "If you are proposing a building retrofit, you naturally prefer your customers to be ready with cash, or to make their own funding arrangements ahead of time so you can focus on what you do.",
      "But the reality is that in a mature marketplace, financing is part of the sales process and applies to at least 50% of the prospect base.  While CleanFi will instantly provide you with different financing scenarios, a few inquiries will steer you to the best solution , accelerate the sales cycle, and possibly save a lot of wasted time for both you and the client in a project that may not pan out.",
      "To set the most basic financing strategy for your client, you’ll want to get two important over-arching data points: real estate equity and profitability, or:  what is the client’s greatest strength: profitability and credit strength, or real estate equity.",
      "By integrating general financing-related inquiries into the consultative sales process, you are more likely to be seen by the prospect as a solution-oriented thinker.  Here are 3 simple lines of dialog to qualify the funding strategy:",
      "For any given project profile, CleanFi returns funders that looking specifically for the answer you are providing.  Inversely, providing wrong basic profile info may mean that you might not see a great solution for your project. So…find out:",
      "Once you have your CleanFi-generated options and proposals in-hand, you’ll want to steer the client toward the one best suited for them, and prepare the client for the underwriting.  Remember that the CleanFi team is always available to help with these questions, and to put them into context for you and the client:",
      "3 questions about the company:",
      "3 questions about their property:",
      "Answers to these questions may not be what you expect, and will inform which mechanism will or will not apply; for example: “We don’t own this property”…Good to know! In that case, will the improvement lifetime exceed the remaining time on their lease? Does the owner approve these improvements?",
      "Answers will also determine how ready the prospect is to apply for financing (“Our non-profit doesn’t have cpa-prepared financials”), and whether we should steer them to a credit or real estate based solution, or whether we can anticipate that a personal guarantee will be needed (see  “How Different Financing Mechanisms Secure Their Risk” for more details).",
      "Sometimes, a conversation between your prospect and CleanFi can avoid a negative outcome by encouraging the prospect to get their documents more ready for the underwriting process before they apply.",
      "If your improvement has government tax credits, or accelerated depreciation, ask the client directly and early if they can absorb them in the year of the installation.",
      "If not, can they apply them to earnings from any of the last three years?",
      "A ”no” on both those questions immediately indicates that the cashflow model may be in trouble if you are integrating the ITC(+adders) into it.  A “third-party owned” financing solution may be best, like a PPA or Energy as a Service (EaaS).",
      "If so, prepare your client for that “good news!” option,  then turn to CleanFi’s BidDesk, where you upload your project files to receive investor proposals for that specific project (subject to underwriting the client).  Note that many investors require a statement from the off-taker (the client) asking for bids, validating the conversation between the contractor and the prospect to be sufficiently advanced to warrant the investor’s time and consideration.  Interested investors will then return project bids, and invite the client to submit a full financing package for underwriting.",
      "From the moment you hear that financing is a possibility, put the client at ease with the statement:\n“There are financing options and strategies for almost every corporate credit profile.  Let’s find the right one for you.”",
      "That will put the customer in a willing position to provide the information you need for the project to succeed.",
      "CleanFi is designed for the multitude of corporate profiles and circumstances you will come across.  With the right information from the client, we can steer the project to a successful financing solution, or help prepare it for that objective.",

    "title": "Structuring financing when there’s no tax credit appetite",
    "content": [
      "If a property improvement project has tax credits and benefits for a property owner who cannot use them, then there are essentially 2 options.  But each has its own challenges.  If you are a developer, pick your projects accordingly.",
      "As of this writing date there is growing liquidity in the transferability market, but it remains limited to projects offering $1,000,000 or more in tax value.  This is because of the IRS “claw-back” risk that buyers incur if something goes wrong in the first 5 years. The revenue value of larger projects affords the time, legal and engineering investments into risk-avoiding due diligence. With time we will see the evolution of a market for sub $1,000,000 tax equity opportunities, as insurance policies create standards for normalizing the risk on these smaller projects so that they can be lumped together into bundles. We are not there yet. For projects over $1,000,000 with fairly standard profiles there seems to be robust seller’s market.",
      "Outliers, such as new technologies, expensive installations, and aggressive performance projections generally end-up as wallflowers at the transferability dance, or have to settle for a highly discounted selling price.",
      "To recap: tax-credit eligible projects valued at $3 million or more and with competitive construction costs using proven technology should be able to secure tax credits within a relatively quick period of time, say 6-weeks to 3 months.  The CleanFi team can help with that.  (see additional article: Transferability – who, how, when, etc..)",
      "But most projects will not fit this profile, because they will be too small. For them, there is…",
      "CleanFi cheat!\nWhen uploading a project that has tax benefits and you are planning on using Transferability, make the project amount the you expect to need to finance after you sell the tax credits.  When you get to the last section of the onboarding process, and it assumes you will be getting tax benefits on that smaller amount, just ignore the calculations and select the last option in the last question.  That way you’ll get financing offers for the post-transferability amount, and you can “Edit” that later.",
      "The common availability of early buyout options in the modern version of these instruments make them an ideal solution for smaller projects with no tax benefit appetite. A 20-year PPA, for example, used to mean a 20-year relationship, like it or not. Now, it is common to be able to get a “fair market value” buyout option as soon as the tax investor’s obligation is over.  In most cases, that’s year six. That should make everyone happy.",
      "Here is the big challenge, however:",
      "If you were going to invest in an installation, you’d want to contract with an off-taker entity that is profitable and stable. If an applicant cannot take advantage of the abundant tax credits and benefits of today’s energy related investments, then are they making money?  True: there are lots of companies that already have a backlog of tax write-offs and tax credits that they need to absorb, and thus need to partner-up to indirectly get the tax benefits value from their energy initiative.  But many other companies may not be “solid” enough or too leveraged to take advantage of those tax benefits. It makes them risky for TPO investors so the contract offers will be minimal and high in cost.",
      "Pre-Paid structures",
      "For entities with shaky financials, it might be better to opt for a prepaid structure. In that scenario, the tax investor limits their exposure by paying 20 to 25% of the project cost (66 to 75 cents on the Tax Equity dollar) while asking the off-taker to pay the entire value of a TPO contract up front.  This value is, not coincidentally, the balance of the project cost. This is called “prepaid” or “deposit” operating leases or PPA’s.",
      "They are handy because ownership automatically gets turned over to the off taker after the required holding period of the tax investor is over (for renewable energy, five years).  CleanFi has structured many of these transactions.",
      "They come with one specific challenge of their own.  If the off-taker does not have cash on hand, they need to borrow the pre-payment or deposit amount. This becomes tricky when both the lender and the tax investor want to use the same lien method on the installation, called a UCC-1(see this article on lien methods: How Different Financing Mechanisms Secure Their Risk).  For that reason financing the deposit or prepayment of a TPO agreement is most facilitated by using C-PACE , because it uses a completely different lean method (real esteate) which will not conflict with the tax investors UC1 filing.  Also, it provides 20 and 30-year Terms, which make the project cash flow beautifully when combined with the tax investor’s contribution. Those structures are commonly known as “PACE-PPA’s”, and are quoted on CleanFi when you put-up a qualifying project.  But read this C-PACE post to understand the mechanism; it requires ownership and available equity in real estate.  Also, when you put up your project on CleanFi, make sure you receive a PACE option in your financing proposals, so you know the project pre-qualifies.",
      "Fortunately, CleanFi instantly quotes all of the different options for financing a project and our team is there to walk you through the best strategies and options at that point.",
      "CleanFi cheat!\nWhen uploading a project that has tax benefits (like solar, or storage), the last section of the process points out tax benefits and gives you options to finance those cumulative benefits ( “Please select your preferred proposal scenario?”).\nWhether you are looking for PACE PPA’s, or to get access to CleanFi’s PPA BidDesk, where investors bid for your project, select: “Offer long term financing options for the entire project”",

    "title": "Construction Financing vs. Project Financing – How to get them both in one place.",
    "content": [
      "Per the aspirational title of this piece, it is a challenge to get both of those critical “building elements” from a single source.  Let’s begin by discussing what each does.",
      "Construction Financing",
      "This is short term, high risk money.  The lender is borrowing on faith, because there is nothing built.  The lender faces myriad of circumstances by which the project could not be completed.  Scenarios include the contractor/developer having issues like technical or financing impasses; there could be supply problems; there could be accidents; there could be relationship issues between various parties.  CleanFi has encountered all of these and the history of project financing disasters causes consternation.",
      "In  “ground-up”, or new building construction financing, lenders have a significant asset they can go after…The land (and whatever part of the construction is completed.  But in retroactive project financing, or in component financing in a new construction (i.e., the solar system that is being finance separately from the building), in the extreme majority of cases there is no security until the project is done.  Thus the rule “high risk = high cost” applies.",
      "Typically in construction financing, the capital interest accumulates with no progress payments from the borrower, until the agreed upon completion date for the project, at which point the principal and the interest are due together in one lump payment.   So the next question is: where do you get the money to pay for that?   In new construction, the same bank that provides the eventual mortgage often provides the construction loan, so the entire amount is rolled into a long-term commercial mortgage, with the underlying building as the security.  But when building a component that is separate from the building, that distinction rarely exist, except in situations further in this article.",
      "Project Financing",
      "Once a project in completed, the risk shifts to whether the borrower can make payments, or whether some issue with the equipment financed will cause the borrower to create problems for the lender.  But now there is something to “lien” (see this related article in our Knowledge Base).  Project financing is a vast universe that covers terms from one year to 30 years or longer.  The applications can be from paying for the installation of a new HVAC on a church, which can be done within a few days, to creating an electrical micro-grid on a college campus, which may require over a year.  So over time, different financing instruments have evolved to accommodate these different circumstances, and to address the full range of project costs.",
      "What Project Financing Mechanisms Have Inherent Construction Financing Options:",
      "C-PACE – There are two main reasons this is a great mechanism for a combo construction/project loan.",
      "1-Per the article referenced above on how lenders lien (or secure their risk) Commercial Property-Assessed Clean Energy loans are secured by the senior-most security possible…the property taxation process.  In effect, the debt stays attached to the property until it is paid off, no matter who owns the property or how many times it changes hands.  So this gives the lender full confidence that the debt will be paid, even if the improvement is never finished (note: every lender in the industry will do everything they can to avoid this situation, including making careful progress payments during construction, and interjecting themselves into the process if something goes awry).",
      "2- The debt financing schedule (the schedule of dates when the borrower needs to make their payments back to the lender) is generally annual, as opposed to monthly. This is because often the payments are made along with, or on the same date as the property taxes are due.  So, before the very first payment is due, there can be months of interest that have accumulated; all of the time that has passed between when the money was placed in service and when the first payment on the debt is made.  That money is subject to interest, but there is no payment on the interest.  So it is “Capitalized”, or added to the entire amount that the borrower is financing.  For that reason, a C-PACE funder is most likely amenable to extending that no payment period by an extra year, or even two, so long as the capitalized interest is added to the principal amount when the repayment begins.  It’s like a larger loan, secured by the property tax assessment.",
      "Third-Party Owned financing –  The best known of those are Power Purchase Agreements (PPA’s), but they can also be Operating Leases, Energy as a Service agreements, Capacity Sales Agreements, etc.  These agreements are usually undertaken by investors who are very familiar with the technology that they are investing in, and they trust both the process and the materials.   So their greatest concern is who will be handling the construction of the improvement and whether the off-taker will be able to make the payments for the duration of the agreed Term.  But if they like the project, they will finance its construction.   You might say “Well, if it’s 3rd-party owned, then that’s not really financing, is it?”  True, if the off-taker carries the PPA to Term.  But most PPA’s today provide a buy-out agreement after the tax benefits have been exhausted (year 6 for solar, storage, thermal, hydrogen), and the owner can, at that time take full possession of the improvement.  That can be financed via a remortgaging, or in some cases even C-PACE.",
      "Exceptions – CleanFi does everything it can to provide creative solutions for project financing, inclusive of cajoling lenders and funders to adopt creative features to their products that we believe would help our users and the marketplace in general.  For that reason, we now have a few Capital Leases and standard Loans that offer construction period options.  In all cases, they will capitalize the interest, just as C-PACE lenders do, so the principal amount borrowed will go up, along with any applicable points and fees.  To find those funding products, read the Notes carefully.  They hide some gems.",

      "We’re a family business.  Leveraging a combined deep knowledge of the contracting business, project financing, and database engineering, Philippe Hartley and Morgan Hartley set out to solve a major hurdle to the greening of America: helping finance the greening of Main Street America, the small and medium businesses that want to do well, and do right, but always find themselves challenged to find the resources to move ahead;  the retailers, the ranchers, the health care providers, the manufacturers, the apartment building owners, the schools, places of worship, etc.  While we serve the interest of business owners and managers, we decided to attack the problem by putting tools in the hands of those that could propagate financing solutions fastest, the contractors.  They are the ones bringing proposals, suggestions, concepts and plans to Main Street.   But few have project finance departments, and few have the expertise to implement one.  They dread the question “Do you offer financing?”.",
      "We wanted to become a virtual project financing department for those tens of thousands of commercial contractors across the country who were going to do the work that would collectively lower our national carbon footprint.",
      "We initially set-out to accelerate one of the greatest new financing inventions of the 21st century: Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy financing (C-PACE).  Plagued by a massive challenge of market education, tremendous diversity of program guidelines between participating localities and states, discouragingly uneven availability and guidelines, we created PACEfi.com in 2021, and were helped in launching it by a portion of a grant awarded to Virginia PACE Authority.  To this day, our instant results of C-PACE project eligibility, competitive funding options and instant application define us as the best national C-PACE resource for small and medium projects in the nation.",
      "Market feedback urged us to quickly expand beyond C-PACE, and include a wide range of mechanisms of financing as options for any project inquiry. PACEfi became CleanFi in the summer of 2022.  Soon after, we became the first FinTech company US to become Finalist, U.S. Department of Energy Solar Prize.",
      "In 2023, CleanFi introduced the White Label, which allows other companies and websites supporting the renewables, efficiency and resiliency contracting industries to offer instant commercial financing solutions to their users.  Using our “out-of-the-box” usability and easy customization, CleanFi White Label Affiliates now count in the dozens reaching all corners of the building owners and contractors universe.",
      "In 2024, CleanFi rolled out BidDesk, a bidding mechanism for those projects needing third-party-owned solutions.  Launching this service initially to serve the PPA mechanism, CleanFi plans to expand it to other funding structures such as Operating Leases, Energy as a Service, and Developer’s PPA’s."

    "title": "How Different Financing Mechanisms Secure Their Risk",
    "content": [
      "When putting a C&I project up on CleanFi,  the resulting proposals are divided into different mechanisms. Each of those mechanisms offers the participating investor a particular method of “securing” their investment.  ",
      "For example, a lender using institutional money that wants a long term annuity product might use C-PACE to leverage the long-term security provided by that mechanism: placing a tax assessment on the property until the debt is paid off.  Another lender might use bank lines of credit that have to be paid off quickly.  So they will chose a mechanism sought by portfolio buyers who look to buy “portfolios” of loans (a large bunch of loans that have very similar profiles) .",
      "In all mechanism options,  a borrower must first and foremost be deemed to be creditworthy by the funder.  This process is called “underwriting”, an analysis of the profit/loss over recent years, balance sheet and obligations, the management team, the robustness of the business, value of assets, the verification of ownership.   Different mechanisms vary in the emphasis they place on these various aspect of the borrower’s profile.",
      "But a strong financial picture alone does not mitigate risk.  The longer the loan, the greater the risk.  So the investor/funder looks for other ways to charge for that risk.  They do so by calibrating rates and terms, which most people are familiar with.  But they also use the “lien” (or claim) offered by the lending mechanism of their choice, as illustrated in the chart below.\n",
      "In property improvement financing, there are two fundamental risk-securing methods:\n1. -Real Estate  – the land and building that the improvement sits on – current valuation less the balance of any liens on the property\n2. -The Improvement Itself (solar, HVAC, storage, chargers, etc.) – a UCC-1 lien would allow for the funder to repossess the asset if defaulted on.  In “third-party-owned” financing (TPO), the owner has total control of the equipment.",
      "Like in most competitive and business scenarios, lenders always want to be in first position on a lien.  In fact, mortgage lenders forbid any lien senior to their own.  That’s also true for UCC-1 lien holders who lien the equipment they are leasing.  If there’s a default on a machine, being in second position on re-possessing that machine is almost worthless.  C-PACE may be the exception to that, because the property tax collection system will generally treat multiple improvement-related debts on a tax bill as one obligation.  For that reason, C-PACE is an excellent mechanism to couple with tax equity on a pre-paid PPA: the c-pace loan pre-pays the PPA and files a tax assessment, and the tax-equity investor files a non-conflicting UCC-1 lien for 5 or 6 years.",
      "There is no rule that says that a funder cannot require both methods to secure a property improvement loan.  For example, one non-profit specialty funder on CleanFi that provides loans to organizations it wants to support will extend a 25-years financing amortization schedule, but requires both a first lien (mortgage) and a UCC-1.",
      "Generally speaking, for non-profits, the picture is the same.  For the municipal market and for tribal projects, the Real Estate liens do not apply, but liens against the improvement have some similarities.",
      "It’s good to have a basic understanding of the mechanism options you find on CleanFi.  Each impacts the underwriting process that the borrower will have to go through, the documents that are requested.  In the case of TPO’s, the developer/contractor as well will be underwritten.",
      "Note that these methods are specifically for commercial property improvement loans.  Business loans, which are typically much shorter term loans like 24-months, are often unsecured and usually entirely determined by credit evaluation.  As a result, they often have a much higher interest rate (capital cost) than the financing methods discussed here.",

      "The Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) provides financial assistance to rural small businesses and agricultural producers in the US specifically for the purchase, installation, and construction of renewable energy systems or energy efficiency improvements, and to conduct feasibility studies for such projects.",
      "REAP grants cover up to 25% or 50% of total eligible project costs.  Grant awards range from $1,500 to $500,000 for energy efficiency improvement projects, and $2,500 to $1,000,000 for renewable energy systems projects.",
      "Two critical things to know upfront about the timing of grant financing\n– You must apply for the grant before you start construction on your project.\n– You will still need financing, even if you get the grant, because the grant funds will be distributed after the project is completed and operational, and because the grant will only cover a portion of the project.",
      "So your financing will need to be able to cover both the grant amount to be repaid in the short term, along with any other tax credit/rebates you might receive after project completion.  The the balance of the project which will require longer term financing.  Contact your CleanFi rep about that split financing process.",
      "Do you qualify for a REAP grant?\nThere are two primary methods of evaluation for a REAP grant:\n1. Geography.   Here is the map\nhttps://eligibility.sc.egov.usda.gov/eligibility/welcomeAction.do?pageAction=rbs",
      "2.Organization.  Do you qualify as either:\n– a small business according to the SBA? Here is where you can check\n– an Agricultural producer that can received 50% of their gross income from direct production of agricultural products.",
      "Does your project qualify?\nHere is what the USDA says qualifies as a project for a grant:\nRenewable Energy Systems",
      "Energy Efficiency Improvements",
      "Scoring system for allocation and distribution of funds:",
      "The USDA website says that their “scoring process allows the USDA to rank applications and prioritize funding for projects that best align with the program’s objectives.  Applications for grants are evaluated using a competitive scoring system that considers a range of criteria, including energy generation or savings, location in a disadvantaged or distressed community, environmental benefits, and more. …The selection process ensures that funds are distributed fairly and equitably among eligible applicants, promoting the development of a diverse range of renewable energy and energy efficiency projects across the country.",
      "REAP Scoring Criteria",
      "There are 100 available points and the main criteria for scoring include:",
      "The total points a project receives determine its ranking within the competition pool. Projects with higher scores are prioritized for funding.",
      "The USDA reminds applicants to:\n– Highlight energy savings or generation\n– Secure matching funds\n– Emphasize environmental benefits\n– Collaborate with your State Energy Coordinator",
      "Need for funding before, during and after the grant.\nA requirement of the grant is to show that you have matching funds.",
      "Additionally, because the grant is not paid until after the project is completed, as is the case with almost all rebates, tax credits and grants, you will need financing to actually build the project, even if part of the funds are paid back in the short term thanks to those programs.",
      "CleanFi will help by matching you with a funder who provide a full use of funds while at the same time allowing an early pay-down and re-amortization of the loan so that the project can benefit from both a bridge financing of those award or credit programs and from a long term financing agreement for the balance of the cost of the project.",
      "Starting your application\nThe USDA website has an excellent walkthrough of\n-how to approach your application\n-where to find your state coordinator for help applying\n-do’s and don’t’s throughout the process of applying.",
